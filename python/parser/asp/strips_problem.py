""" This is the file you should look at to understand the data-structures
    required to make your CNF encodings.

    There is a Problem, which has a start state and goal and lists of
    actions and propositions.

    Each Action has a precondition and positive and negative effect.
    These are lists of Propositions.

    Each Propositions has a list of Actions for which it is a precondition,
    a positive and a negative effect.

    self.action_first_step will either be None (in which case you will not have to deal with it)
    otherwise it will be a dictionary {Action : int} mapping each action
    to the first step it could possible be executed (as computed by the plangraph).

    self.fluent_mutex will either be None (in which case you will not have to deal with it)
    otherwise it will be a dictionary {int : [(Proposition, Proposition), ...]} which maps
    each time t step up to some N to a list of pairs of propositions.
    Each pair of Propositions is mutex at the time step t.

    All Propositions which are mutex at step N are also mutex at steps > N.
